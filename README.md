1. Introduction

The Affinity mobile application ("Application") is a mobile application that is meant to provide the individuals using our Service and Application ("Users")
 the possibility to mutually exchange movie ratings in geographic proximity (typically 0~30 meters of radius) using direct wireless communication between
 mobile devices. The device to device connection is established directly and without intermediaries using wireless transmission technologies such as Bluetooth
 or WiFi comprised in the Google Nearby Connection API. No central entity is able to observe, track, or monitor data exchanges between other Users. 
 
The Application is part of the research endeavor of the Service-centric Networking chair at the Technical University of Berlin in the field of
decentralized/distributed recommender systems. In lign with this research, we are eager to explore Device-to-Device (D2D) technologies that foster collaboration
between users without central movie recommendation providers such as Netflix. Users are collecting rating information of nearby other Users over time and can
thus calculate recommendation on their smartphones locally. In a nutshell, the Application replicates the Word-of-Mouth phenomonen of recommendation in social
 interactions in digital D2D-fashion interactions. We follow in the footsteps of the PocketLens project.
 
#The usage data collected by Google (implementing Google Analytics) - as the store provider - are limited to the usage behavior of the elements within
#the app such as usage time, [fill in what is actually being tracked by Google]. This explicitly does not include personal movie preferences or information
#on data exchanges between users in provimity.

#This Privacy Notice describes how we process personal app usage data we collect from individuals in relation to their use of our Application and the measures we 
#take to assist the users of our Application to comply with data protection law that applies to them. In legal terms, we are the data controller, as we
# determine the means and/or purposes of the processing.

This Privacy Notice only covers data processing carried out by Affinity. The Privacy Notice does not address, and we are not responsible for, the privacy practices
 of any third parties.

2. Data Collection

The personal data collected from Users is limited to device ID, geographic location, the time and date of the use of the Application. We do not collect names, e-mail
 addresses, home addresses or phone numbers. 
 
At the core of the Application lies mutual data exchange of rating information of the form Movie:Rating:Timestamp between Users. A collection of a User's rating information
("User Profile") is at no time collected by the Application. Users' Profiles are only shared between Users in geographic proximity (typically 0~30 meters of radius).
We stress that data exchanges do in particular do neither involve nor require an active internet connection. Individuals that have not installed the Application are
 not eligible for User Profile exchange. For convenience, Users are not asked to give permission to each and every sharing request, instead the user may
 activate and deactive sharing such that data sharing can happen also when the User is not actively handling the Application. 
When using the Application we automatically record certain technical information such as the Internet Protocol address (IP address), the device address and/or device type.
We do not use Google Analytics, an analytics service provided by Google, Inc. ("Google").
# The information generated about your use of the Application (including your
# IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States. On behalf of the Technische Universit&auml;t Berlin, Google will use this
# information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the Application, compiling reports on Application usage activity and providing other services relating to
# Application activity. You can refuse the use of Google Analytics within the Application. However, please note that if you do this, you may not be able to use the full functionality of the Application.

 legitimate grounds for our processing that override User’s interests, rights and freedoms or for legal claims.
Right to restriction of processing: Any User has the right to obtain from us restriction of processing of User’s personal data, as foreseen by applicable data protection law,
 e.g. to allow our verification of accuracy of personal data after User’s contesting of accuracy or to prevent us from erasing personal data when personal data are no longer
 necessary for the purposes but still required for User’s legal claims or when our processing is unlawful. Restriction of processing may lead to fewer possibilities to use
 our Services.

 backup systems after the active data have been erased. Such copies shall be erased as soon as reasonably possible.

How to use these rights: To exercise any of the above mentioned rights, the User should primarily use the functions offered by our Services. If such functions are however
 not sufficient for exercising such rights, Customer shall send us a letter or email to the address set out below under Contact, including the following information: device ID.
 We may request additional information necessary to confirm User’s identity. We may reject requests that are unreasonably repetitive, excessive or manifestly unfounded.

7. Security

We implement and maintain reasonable and appropriate technical and organizational security measures to protect the personal data we process, from unauthorized access,
 alteration, disclosure, loss or destruction. Access to the user data is only available to Technische Universität Berlin employees within the group, and only to those who
 have been granted access explicitly.

Should despite of our security measures, a security breach occur that is likely to result in a risk to the data privacy of Users, we will inform the relevant Users and other
 affected parties, as well as relevant authorities when required by applicable data protection law, about the security breach as soon as reasonably possible.

Necessary for the purposes. We may share your personal data with third parties to the extent our Services foresee such disclosure and Users submit their personal data for that purpose, such as to facilitate our Services.

 to meet any applicable law and/or court order, (ii) to detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, and/or (iii) to protect the interests, properties
 or safety of us, our Users or the public, in accordance with the law. We will notify Users about such disclosure, as far as reasonably possible.

 The User has the right to withdraw this consent at any time.
